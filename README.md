# ASP.NET MVC 5 Mixed Authentication
(Web Forms + Windows) 



#### How its done ?

The basic idea is to have a managed handler to perform windows authentication, then hand control over to the cookies authentication middleware.

> No special requirements! Visual Studio Express 2013 is all that you need.


#### Running the solution locally

* Clone the repository: ```git clone git@github.com:MohammadYounes/MixedAuth.git```

* Open the solution using Visual Studio, build and run.


#####Enabling Windows Authentication on IIS Express.

* From Solution Explorer, select MixedAuth project then press F4 to view Project Properties.
* Make sure "Windows Authentication" is enabled.
